# Cocktail Overflow

#### Herein lies a flashcard app that matches an endless array of cocktails to their respective specs, the single most critical key-value pair to making cocktails. Flashcards are a tool for memory retention. Cocktails are a tool for memory destruction. Much like event listeners, cocktails should contain no more than three parameteres, as it's sloppy form and pretentious.

#### Buttons are images. Images are buttons. Unless it's the background of the flashcard div. That's not a button. 
#### Also, the one that is not a baby is dead, since as the time of this writing its intended function to log flashcards of the user's choosing isn't being logged properly or expressed.

#### User's story 

#### As an itinerant bartender, I want to view a randomized set of cocktails to test my knowledge. A simple thumbnail for each cocktail would help memorization. The main ingredients and measurements (i.e. "specs") are the important data to test, along with maybe glassware and mixing method.

#### I'll want to access the app on a large screen for casual study in  between jobs and on a mobile device as I'm waiting to interview and showcase my knowledge. The cleaner and more _minimalist_ the interface the better.

#### With respect to user's preference for scaled-back feel, app forgoes a keyboard-functionality, as this would make little sense, tap-tap-tapping the little keyboard on a handheld device. Maybe if they bring back the Blackberry.
