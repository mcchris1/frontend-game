# Cocktail Overflow

#### Herein lies a flashcard app that matches an endless array of cocktails to their respective specs, the single most critical key-value pair to making cocktails. Flashcards are a tool for memory retention. Cocktails are a tool for memory destruction. Much like event listeners, cocktails should contain no more than three parameteres.

#### One of the buttons is dead, since as the time of this writing its intended function to cache flashcards of the user's choosing isn't working.

#### User's story 

#### As an itinerant bartender, I want to view a randomized set of cocktails to test my knowledge. A simple thumbnail for each cocktail would help prime the visualization centers and pair nicely with the attendant ingredients and measurements. Glassware and mixing instructions seem a mite superfluous for someone with my powers of intuition, but I'll leave their inclusion to the developers' discretion. 

#### I imagine I'd only have occasion to use the app on my phone, waiting to interview for gigs, say, or as a way to kill time with my regulars behind the bar. The cleaner and more _minimalist_ the interface the better.

#### With respect to user's preference for scaled-back feel, app forgoes a keyboard-functionality, as this would make little sense post-Blackberry, tap-tap-tapping the little keyboard on a handheld device.
